How to Play the game?
    The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

Each turn:
    The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
    The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
    If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
    If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
    The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

##KNOWN issues:
    The game might not work properly or not work at all in the older versions of browsers. So, kindly update the browser and run the game.
    In small devices, the same problem might occur.

##Dependencies:
    The files are self dependent and even uses default fonts. The jQuery is added just in case as i was unsure whether some of the 
    js commands i used was from jQuery library.
